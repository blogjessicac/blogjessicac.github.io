<!-- BELOW IS THE UNORDERED LIST!!!! -->



<!-- GOALS -->
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
	<li id="blk2" style="font-size:60px;">Goal:</li>
<ul id="blk2" style="list-style-type:none;">
	<li style="font-size:25px; color:#685148;">Specific: What do you want to create with code? Why?</li>
		<ul style="font-size:30px;"><li>We want to create an enviorment that serves as a safe space and support system for people interested in coding to come and discover code on their own.</li></ul>	
	

	<li style="font-size:25px; color:#685148;">Measureable: What components do you need to develop what you would like to make with code. <span style="font-size:15px; font-weight:bold; color:#DBD0CD;">ex. To make a pizza you need the following components. Dough, Sause, Cheese, Toppings, and Oven Heat.</span></li>
		 <ul style="font-size:30px;"><a href="SMARTcreateCommunity.html" target="_blank"><li>To create a community: most people that say they are not good at tech stuff also have no desire to try and be good at tec stuff. so why would they even show up? Also how do you even create a community from scratch?</li></a>

 <a href="SMARTcreateCommitment.html" target="_blank"><li>Instill a sense of self determination and a no quit attitude: no clue how to do that. Coding is hard and frustrating and confusing. You have to want it. We cant make you want it</li></a>

<a href="SMARTcreateBrainstorms.html" target="_blank"><li>A space where people share the knowledge they came with and the knowledge that they have gained to help each other out in a jam. ((i.e. group brainstorming sessions when someone is stuck))</li></a></ul>


	

<li style="font-size:25px; color:#685148;">Attainable: Based off what you already know and what you have learned that you need to know to accomplish your goal. What can you fully complete in the next month that will give you a sense of accomplishent towards your goal?</li>
		<ul style="font-size:30px;"><li>Based off what we have learned so far it seems we will have to have a CLUB=COMMINITY that we will have to currate i.e. have an application process or direct invitations that is not open to everyone, just committed indivudals.<br><br>

We will also have to have DROP IN ACTIVITIES for anyone, designed to instil intrest in being a part of a curated group as well as attempt to instil some of the group values into ppl in order to have a pool to currate out of.<br><br>

Maybe blogs can be those activities, but then again blogs are best not to be connected to programs?<br><br>

Also add in the fact that everything is virtual right now has us thinking that drop in activities may be better in a virtual format.<br><br>

Then again why create activities if our overall goal is self exploration? create self exploration activities?! if the point is SELF exploration how does one accomplish that exactly?

<br><br>...AAAAAAHHHHH!</li></ul>

<li style="font-size:40px; background-color:yellow; color:#685148">NEED

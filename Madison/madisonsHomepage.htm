Some feedback from the group:

**try changing your font family to a diff font

**is the strip on the bottom of your page supposed to be a picture?

**maybe make your links a diff color

**in your header make sure your last name is capitalized

**maybe instead of green on green switch up one of the colors

<!--Ms. J: why is your body class body? also your head class head? you dont have this class listed in your css....I think this might come from using that site you have been using. I Challenge us to learn the code so you can type up a site that looks like the one you made in the program you like.  -->

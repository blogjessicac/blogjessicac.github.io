<h1>Time to Plan!</h1>

<p>
Now you have a web page. Good Work! Now its time to add some more pages. What do you want to put out there online? Some people come just knowing that they want to do, a lot more than some dont though. Below is a tool you can use to help you narrow down the specifics of what you want to do.</p>

<ul>
<li> Create a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp" target="_blank" >Nesting of Lists</a> like the one below.</li>

<li> Your Lists needs to have an alternating color scheme (like the one below), but you do not have to use the same colors we did. {we call our scheme
&nbsp  
<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=html%20color%20code%20for%20red&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=html%20color%20code%20for%20re&sc=1-22&sk=&cvid=1704F47728604AC58C6DB688544C1660" target="_blank" >Raspberry</a> -

<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=html%20color%20code%20for%20tan&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=html%20color%20code%20for%20r&sc=5-21&sk=&cvid=A4CE8414385C4ED79F2855BB0E72BF2F" target="_blank" >Pie</a>
&nbsp }</li>

<li>
Inside your Lists, you need to type in answers to all the questions that you can. For the questions you cannot answer, you can leave them blank.</li>

<li>You need to add <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">links</a> on both this page and your homepage that connect the two pages to each other. The link on your homepage can be a "Secret" Link*.</li>

<li>Be sure to bring your files to the next Club Meeting that you used to make your table along with any updates to your homepage so you can update your page.</li>

<li>We put a "Secret" Link that connects to our Dev Page on the <a href="https://rcplne.github.io/" target="_blank">homepage.</a> Bet you cant find it ;)</li>
</ul>
<p><br><span style="font-size:15px; color:#DBD0CD;">*Secret Links: links that do not have link colors or text decorations. The link could be just a period or text that is the same color as your background. Thus showing up as a blank spot that only you know is there. The link will take you to your Dev Page.</span></p>

<!-- <h1>Having trouble coming up with something?</h1>
<h1>Try this:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Look over the Pi Club member's webpages. See if you see anything you like/would like to copy or remix.</li>
<li>Brainstorm about the types of things you like to use code to do. For example, do you enjoy tick-tock videos? What kind of coding did they use to make the app? Do some research, and see if any inspiration strikes.</li>
<li>If all else fails, make a web page about a hobby or interest of yours. Next, improve the way your pages look and behave. Next, research what it would take to host your webpage yourself? Learn the code, borrow a raspberry pi, make it happen.</li>
</ul> -->

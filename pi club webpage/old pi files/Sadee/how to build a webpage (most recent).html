<p> building a web page may seem difficult but once you learn a few simple steps it can be easy as pie! 
the first step of building a web page is to put <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of your page then type the following code...</p>

<p> ______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> "!DOCTYPE html" </p>
<p> "html" </p> 
  <p> "head" </p>
<p> "title" </p> 
  <p> "/head" <p> 
  <p>  "body" </p>
<p> "header"      "/header" </p>
<p> "main" </p>
<p> "p"             "/p" </p>
<p> "/main" </p>
<p> "/body" </p> 
<p> "/html" </p>
<p> ______________________________________________________________________ </p>

<p> Before each of these commands you must put a < less than sign or it will not work an example is... <headd> you must also put a greater than symbol > at the END of the command to make it work. in addition to these signs a slash / must be added at the beggining of each closing command. If you dont know what the closing command is it is the second command with the same name. An example is... if you put "head" before your head(basically the title) then you would have to put "/head" after you have typed you title for it to be complete. try this and type your title in between the "title" spaces and your main paragraph in between the "p" spaces. that should be all if I remembered correctly but if it doesnt work then sorry, because I cant really help. For info on how to add images and style your page refer to lydea. </p>
<p> BTW the "quotations" stand for greater and less than signs because if I actually put those signs then the words inside them will not show up </p>

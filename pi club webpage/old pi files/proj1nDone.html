<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;">So you have finished a project, how does it feel? Good, we hope. Now that we have a product let's evaluate.</p>

<ol>
<li>What parts of the process did you enjoy?</li>
<li>How can you do more of that going forward??</li>
<li>What parts of the process did you hate?</li>
<li>How can you do less of that going forward?</li>
<li>What could you add to make this product better?</li>
<li>What could you add to make this product worse?</li>
<li>What are your logical next steps?</li>
<li>What do you want to do next?</li>
<li>Is what you want to do diffrent from your logical next steps?</li>
<li>If what you want to do and your logical next steps are different is there a way you can combine the two?</li>
<li>What questions were not asked here that should have been?</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;">Record those questions as well as the answers to them on your first strike page. Now that we have evaluated our completed project Its time to start planning project #2!</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;">Go back to your original Dev Plan page. At the end of the table, add a new row and call it Mission Accomplishments. In this new section, add in your project title and a brief description of what the project was or how it went. You will need to link the first strike page for that project to either the title or the description. If you want an example, you can check out <a href="pieDevPlan.html" target="_blank">OUR</a> Dev Plan page.</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;">Look over your dev plan. Does the experience of this project change anything? Update your Dev Plan using a new font color. That way, you have the original text as well as the updated information.</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;"> Begin creating project #2! Be sure to create a new first-strike page (second-strike) and link it to your project title or description in your Mission Accomplishments section of your Dev Plan. </p>

	<li>"PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO QUIT ARE DRIVEN BY COMMITMENT, NOT BY THEIR FEELINGS...If you allow feelings to determine your actions, then motivation will be sporadic. When you feel good, you're inspired; when you feel bad, uninspired...Our feelings may not be consistent, but our commitment can be."</li>
	<li>"TIME YOU FEEL LIKE QUITTING TRY A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE...a never quit mindset doesnt mean you wont have to alter your plans to get to where you have committed to going. "</li>
	<li>"RESIST THINKING ABOUT A SETBACK IN GLOBAL TERMS....Just because you have failed in one area does not make you an overall failure. avoid the thoughts of self-doubt and self-pity. Embracing responsibility for our attitudes and actions is central to a never quit mindset.  "</li></ul><br><br>

	<ul>
	<li>Here are four keys to develop a ever give up attitude (over time)</li>
	<li>1. Change your perspective aka a particular attitude toward or way of regarding something; a point of view</li>
	<li>2. Be persistent, aka the firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition</li>

	<li>3. Develop Grit aka mental toughness developed over time by being persistent. It involves being persistent and passionate about achieving your goals no matter how many obstacles you face or how long it takes. aka not willing to sacrifice the long term value for the short term gain of quitting.</li>
	<li>4. Be Resilient aka able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult condition. or able to recoil or spring back into shape after bending stretching or being compressed. </li>

	<ul>
	<li>Everything is possible: you cant do anything only when you are dead ((aka you can do anything but you cant do everything well))</li>
	<li>Mistakes=learning=expereience mistakes means you are learning how to do something better. ((changing of perspective can help when it comes to fixing mistakes)) </li>
	<li>Work on Why when you feel like quitting you must think about why you have started ((you started because you wanted to see if you could make --- with code. have you done all that you can yet? then keep going))</li>
	<li>Quitting is not an option (ish(if you make up your mind before trying something that as soon as it gets hard you will stop then why start?)esq) </li>

	<ul>
	<li>SUCCEED AT SOMETHING ELSE: human beings love being rewarded. In fact we, crave it. When you've been working toward the achievement of a goal for a long time, but your efforts haven’t resulted in any rewards—you haven’t made any money, you haven’t achieved anything you can brag about to others, you don’t really feel like you can pat yourself on the back, and so on–you’ll probably be tempted to quit. One way to stop yourself from quitting is to take a break and go do something else that you know will be rewarded ((even if its not even remotley in the same vein)) Remind yourself of what success feels like. Then, allow that success to sustain you for a while longer while you take another swing at your goal. </li>

<p>
Now that you are part of our club its time to figure out what you want to work on. Some people come just knowing that they want to try coding.  Others come with something specific in mind. Why ever you are joining us, we are glad you are here. Below is a tool you can use to either figure out what you want t code or to help you narrow down the specifics of what you already have been doing, or wanting to do. </p>

<p>To help us figure out what comes next we are going to make a new page. We call it the Dev Page.</p>

<h1>How to create the Dev Page</h1>

<ul>
<li> Create a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">TABLE</a> like the one below. The top row and the left column should look just like the table below.</li>

<li> Your table needs to have an alternating color scheme (like the one below), but you do not have to use the same colors we did. {we call our scheme
&nbsp  
<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=html%20color%20code%20for%20red&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=html%20color%20code%20for%20re&sc=1-22&sk=&cvid=1704F47728604AC58C6DB688544C1660" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">RASPBERRY</a>

<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=html%20color%20code%20for%20tan&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=html%20color%20code%20for%20r&sc=5-21&sk=&cvid=A4CE8414385C4ED79F2855BB0E72BF2F" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">PIE</a>
&nbsp }</li>

<li>
Inside your table, you need to write (type) in answers to all the questions that you can. For the questions you cannot answer, you can leave them blank. The statement in the Row Header is what the questions address. The questions that make up the table below are ones that we came up with to help us explore the Header statements. If you do not like our questions, you can create your own. <span style="background-color:#e19d9d; color:#cd5c5c;">The only requirement is that you have four questions in your row. Those questions must address the Header statement.</span> You can have text consisting of questions and answers in your table. Or you can add the questions as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">comments</a> in your code and only have the text showing be the answers to the questions.</li>

<li>The part of the header for your table that says {aka a communication plan} must be a link back to <a href="" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">THIS</a> page. (the one we are currently on)</li>

<li>You also need to add <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d;">LINKS</a> on both this page and your homepage that connect them. The link on your homepage can be a "Secret Link." <!--<span style="color:#e19d9d;">-->Secret Links: links that do not have link colors or text decorations. The link could be just a period or text that is the same color as your background. Thus showing up as a blank spot that only you know is there. The link will take you to your Dev Page.</span></li>

<li>Be sure to <a href="mailto:jcooper@richlandlibrary.com?subject=infinity pi initiation= message" style="color:#9e619e; background-color:#e19d9d;">EMAIL</a> us the files you used to make your table along with any updates to your homepage so we can update your page.</li>

<li>We put a secret link to our Dev Page on our <a href="https://rcplne.github.io/" target="_blank" style="background-color:#e19d9d">HOMEPAGE.</a> Bet you cant find it ;)</li>
</ul>

<!--<p>
Make a new web page that consist of a table like the one below. The top header should say Dream Project Development Plan {aka: a communication plan} just like mine. The headers on the left side should also be the same (Goals, Projects, Feed-Back etc.). for the rest of the table you need to answer the questions you can. for the questions you dont have answers for yet you can leave them blank. The table should have alternating colors for each row, but you do not have to use the colors scheme that I used.</p>

<p>
Once you are finished I would like you to link this new page to your homepage. You can link your table with a secret link if you like. One that does not have link colors or highlight colors. It could even be just a period or a blank spot that only you know where to click. Also be sure to email us the files you used to make your table along with any updates to your homepage so we can update your page.</p>

<p>
We put a secret link on our homepage, bet you cant find it ;)

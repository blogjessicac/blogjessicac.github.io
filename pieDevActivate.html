<p>As we indicated on our <a href="pieDevPlan.html" target="_blank">Development Plan</a> We want to create a coding community at the Northeast Branch of the Richland Library System.</p>

<p>The thing is we had a little one, and then a Global Pandimic shut everything down. We have not heard or seen our members in over a year. We think it would be great to get back together again (virtually). Maybe even gain some new (virtual) members. </p>

<p>How would we accomplish that we all ask? Enter, our first strike proposal. </p>

<ul>
<li>Goal:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>The smallest part of my dream project that will give me a sense of accompolishment is <span style="color:pink; text-decoration:underline; font-size:30px;">We would like to come up with a possible way to start an active virtual club.</span></li>
		<ol style="color:pink;">
		<li>Brainstorm:</li>
		<a href="pieDevActivateBlog.html" style="color:yellow;"><li style="color:yellow;">We could turn the pages we are making to walk members thru the process blog posts and see if we can get the put on the main webpage</li></a>
		<li>We can see if we can get a clickable link to our webpage on northeasts webpage ((highly unlikly, library would def want to brand manage the heck out of our page, and they would never go for that so we hated this idea as soon as we had it))</li>
		<li>We could make flyers and place them around the branch and hope people who trickle in take them and respond. ((We did that last time, how did that work out? Right.))</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
<li>Message:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>I will create a web page connected to my homepage featuring this small part of my project. The page I create will sum up my Dream Project in full. The page will also give viewers a taste of what I plan to create. The link to that page is<span style="color:pink; text-decoration:underline; font-size:30px;"></span> ___________________.

</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Once the page is complete, I will email the link to <a href= "mailto:jcooper@richlandlibrary.com?subject= devActivate page">Infinity Pi's Email</a>. They will distribute the link to my fellow club members so they can give me feedback. The summary of what they said is<span style="color:pink; text-decoration:underline; font-size:30px;"></span> _________________________.

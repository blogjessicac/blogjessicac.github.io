<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
<h1 id="step1">Step One <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Lets start here, with a brief explination of what HTML is and What TAGS are 
<ul>
<li><a href ="http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/whatishtml.php" target="_blank"> What is HTML a simple guide </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank"> HTML Introduction </a> </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step2">Step 2 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1> 
now that you know what tags, and tag attributes are as well as some essential tags open a notepad file, save it as {<u>insert your name</u>}_infinity_homepage.htm and type the following tags in, remebering all your opening < > and closing < / > tags: <br><br><br>

!DOCTYPE html<br>
html<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /title<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; header &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /main<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/body<br>
/html<br><br><br>
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step3">Step 3 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a> use the search feature to find out what the Doctype, html, head, title, body, header, and main TAGS are and what they do. using a comment !-- this is where you write out your definitions -- with just opening tags < > write the definitions of each item and what they do above each tag. for example <br><br>
!-- the doctype tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
!DOCTYPE html<br><br>
!-- the html tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
html<br><br>
!-- the head tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head<br><br>
!-- the title tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /title<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /head<br><br>
!-- the body tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body<br><br>
!-- the header tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; header &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /header<br><br>
!-- the main tag is ______ and does _____ --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /main<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/body<br>
/html<br><br><br>
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step4">Step 4 <a href="#top">^top^</h1>
Now lets add some content to your page. This page is going to serve as your hompage for Infinity Pi club and able to be accessed from our <a href="https://rcplne.github.io" target="_blank"> website. </a> Create headers and add some text to your paragraph to say a little about you and what your page is for. We will add some more later so dont worry about adding to much.<br><br><br>
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step5">Step 5 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now double click on your hmtl file, while leaving the notpad file open. The file should open up in your web browser, because you saved it with the .htm or .html extention (an extention is the ending of the file name, like myresume.DOCX or funnycatmeme.GIF). See how it just looks like a word document sort of. plain, white, flush left (all lined up on the left side.), lets change that. </p>
<p>Open a new notepad file (by right clicking on the notepad icon and then left clicking on the notepad in that menu that pops up.) and save it as <u>insert your name</u>_infinity_homepage_stylesheet.css. </p> Next go back to your html hompage file in notepad and add:  <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; link rel="stylesheet"  href="<u>insert your name</u>_infinity_homepage_stylesheet.css." <br><br>
 inside your head tags. *dont forget your opening and closings < > and  < / > </p>


<p>
<h1  id="step6">Step 6 <a href="#top"><^top^</a></h1>
Read these links about CSS
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">CSS Introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp" target="_blank">CSS Syntax</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank">CSS Selectors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp" target="_blank">How To Add CSS</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp" target="_blank">CSS Colors</a></li>
</ul>
Now experiemnt with changing the way your webpage looks by changing text, fonts, and colors.
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step7">Step 7 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Next we are going to add some pictures. Read this link to see how to add images to your page. 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" target="_blank">HTML Images</a></li>
</ul>
When adding images keep in mind that some images that you may find on the internet cannot be used because of copywrite issues. When choosing images that are not yours be sure to follow these steps.
<ol>
<li>go to google images and search for the image you would like, like dog or trees</li>
<li>when your images appear click on tools at the top of the page</li>
<li>under your drop down options that appear choose usage rights</li>
<li>under usage rights select labeled for noncommercial reuse with modifications</li>
<li>from this point you can use any images you see that are still in your search results. </li>
</ol>
Add an image to the main section of your webpage. <strong>**I HIGHLY suggest that you DO NOT add an image of yourself, your friends, or your family.**</strong>
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step8">Step 8 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now if you want to embed a website or part of a website like a youtube video or a google map you will need to use something called an iframe. To learn more about iframes read this link.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">HTML iframes</a></li>
</ul>
Most sites like youtube and google maps will have an option to share and one way to share is with an embedded link. all you have to do is copy and paste that embed link they give you into the main body of your webpage. For this site you do not have to create your own iframe links, but somewhere on your site include an iframe from an outside site. (I like EMBEDING giphy.com gifs)
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step9">Step 9 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
You can also make list for your site. If you want you can also make list within your list. To learn more about list read this link
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp" target="_blank">List Link</a> </li>
</ul>
Now that you know how List (ordered, unordered, description, nested, horizontal) Add some lists to your webpage, and be sure to alter the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_list.asp" target="_blank"> CSS </a> for the lists as well
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step10">Step 10 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now we are going to make some more pages and link them together. Using the previous steps make three additional pages to this page. Be sure to use the same naming method we used for the page we have been working on. <br><br>
<u>insert your name</u>/_{whatever you want your page name to be}.htm <br><br>
The pages can be about whatever you want but include all the elements we have leared about in all of them, as well as css (you can decide if you want different css for each page or you want them all to share the same css)
</p>


<p>
<h1  id="step11"> Step 11 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now that you have created some additional pages we are going to link them. To learn more about making links read these links
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank"> About Links </a></li>
<li>Read UNTIL you get to ABSOLUTE PATHS *note this is from a specific programs webpage, we are not using that program but some of the info presented pretains to us.<a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/supplement/pathnames-explained-absolute-relative-unc-and-url.htm" target="_blank"> About Pathnames </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp" target="_blank"> About Filepaths </a></li>
</ul>
Now that you know about linking pages link your new pages to your index page. Link one page in a list and use an image to link one page. Be sure to use your A tags correctly! 
</p>



<p>
<h1  id="step12"> Step 12 <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Next we are going to make a navigation menu for our sites. You can leave the links to your pages that you already made but we are going to make a universal navigation bar that will appear on all our pages to make sure people know how to get around your site. Read these links to learn about the nav tag.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">CSS Nav Bar</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp" target="_blank" > Id attribute HTML </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp" target="_blank"> NAV Tag HTML (we WON'T be using this but it is good to know about) </a></li>
</ul>
Now that you have the hang of styling your nav menu try using padding, play with the background color and text colour, properties for you links like underline and colors based on actions like hover or click, text decorations or naw for your UL and OL, make rounded corners for your menus using the border radius property. Try making your pictures have rounded corners.<br><br>
If you get confused do some digging around on W3Schools or Google.

</p>



<p>
<h1  id="step14"> Step 14  <a href="#top">^top^</a></h1>
Now you need to save your webpage files to your Pi, be sure to put them in a folder with your name on the desktop of your Pi. You also need to make a notepad file named please update {insert your name here} webpage. That way I will know you want to make your page live.

"We all have our time machines, don't we. Those that take up back are memories...And those that carry us forward, are dreams"<br>
~H.G. Wells <br>
{English writer. Prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, an works of social commentary,history, satire, biography, and autobiography, and even two books on recreational war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called the "father of science fiction" along with jules verne and hugo gernsback. During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction". Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption – dubbed “Wells’s law” – leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as "O Realist of the Fantastic!". His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898) and the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907). }<br><br>

Rand describes objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute." Objectivisms main tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (see direct and indirect realism) that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of ones life is the pursuit of ones on happiness (see rational egoism), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of rreality into a physical form, a work of art, that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally. }<br><br>

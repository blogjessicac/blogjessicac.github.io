<h1>Ms. Jessicas Infinity Pi Home Page</h1>

<p>
Hi! I'm Miss Jessica! I lead a Coding Club at the <a href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com/locations/northeast" target="_blank">Northeast Branch of the Richland Library</a> called Infinity Pi.</p>

<p>I came up with the name Infinity Pi myself. Why did you come up with that name, you may ask. To which I would reply, it sounds cool! Dont you think?</p>

<p>Anyway below are some links to some coding projects I think you should check out.

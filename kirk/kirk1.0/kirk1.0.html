Some feedback from the group: 

**have less info on your page or maybe make it bullet points. with the amount of text you have it becomes hard to see whats most important. You could also just add more space so its easier to read.

**make your nav bar clickable

**maybe use a colored background/more colors in general in your page

           <h3>Who am I</h3>
           <p>
           My name is Kirk Carlson. I am a retired software engineer interested
           in helping others learn how to program. This page is to show some basic
           HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming.
           </p>

           I like playing around with an 11th century art form called Girih.
           an example is below. The Persians learned how to include elaborate
           knotted forms in their architecture by defining five basic tile
           shapes: a decagon (10-sided polygon), a pentagon, a rhombus, an
           elongated hexagon and a concave hexagon called a bow tie. These
           shapes can tessellate to cover any surface. What makes their design
           special is that it includes strapping lines that meet at the edges
           of the polygons to form the knot patterns.
           </p>
		   
           <p>
           More information about girih can be found on Wikipedia at
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih">Girih</a>
		   and
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih_tiles">Girih Tiles</a>

<!--Ms. J: maybe add a caption under this picture link to let us know we should click it and that if scroll it will light up. Also you can use the target attribute to make the image open in a new tab if you like. In the paragraph following the pic link I think you should use the <br> tag to space it out a bit so its easier to read. -->

           <p>
           The geeky explanation of this is that
           the figure is generated using turtle graphics, a way to draw using
           a series of turns and forward commands in JavaScript (see
           <a href="https://turtlegraphics.fun">https://turtlegraphics.fun</a>).
           There are
           five functions to draw the five girih pentagon (this figure uses
           only three of them (decagon, hexagon, and bow-tie). There are
           a lot of simple repeats, each one uses another function call.
           You can see the basic design uses the dotted red lines. The
           polygons are outlined in the fine blue lines. The girih or 
           knot pattern is colored to make it easier to trace their design.
           Because this design has a lot of symmetry, there are a lot of
           repeated patterns.
           The turtle graphics generates a SVG (Scalable Vector
           Graphics) file, including its
           own stylesheet to select the colors and some JavaScript to 
           animate the drawing as you roll a mouse over the drawing.
           This is the same techniques that you use to write an HTML document
           with its CSS stylesheet and JavaScript Code.
           (Of course that isn't working within an HTML document, it
           does work if you open the file directly with the browser by clicking
           on the figure. Rolling the mouse over the figure will high light a
           single chain. Using the ']' and '[' keys, you can advance and backup
           on a simple animation. <em>The drawing may need to be panned to see
           the action on some screens.</em>)

           <h3>What do I want to learn?</h3>
           <p>
           I want to learn how to teach coding on the Raspberry Pi.
           It is cool that such a small and cheap device has a lot of the
           programming power of a network server. In fact it uses Linux
           which is the same operating system used by many internet network
           servers. So if you learn how to use the pi, you will know a lot
           about how to program on a network server.

           This is the first item of a list. I looked up on Google
           how to change the type of marker with the .css code.

I love to cook/bake and I love food, especially ramen noodles, and ice-cream.

I love art but prefer drawing and collageing to painting. However, my favourite type of art is body art, mostly Mehendi Henna. I want to be an actress, model or cosmetologist when I am older.

 For now though I just go to school,and do work :( I also volunteer at the library and dogsit for my neighbour. 

	My mum is from England and my dad is from here, I have three siblings, two brothers, and a sister. Thier names are Lydea, thomas, and Henry. As for pets we currently have four Guinea Pigs, and two mice. However, we used to have six guinea pigs, three mice, a bird, and five fish, at a different time we also had two gerbils, two dogs, a hamster, frogs, and a different mouse.

	 I have never really coded before this class, and I'm going to put my things on here. And thats just a little bit (or a lot) about me. </P>

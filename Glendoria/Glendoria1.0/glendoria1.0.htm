<!--Ms.J: to make your lines seperated on your site like they are here you can use a <br> tag in between them for ex.

more about me: <br>
my name is glendria e. <br>
i live in columbia,sc <br>

or you can use an ordred or unordered list to make them all have bullet points. I suggest you make this website displays my body of work an h1-h6 tag insted of part of the paragraph.

    <p>
        This website displays my body of work.

	<!--Ms. J: for this part I would either put this whole section in a p tag or make the programs i have created in the group are a h1-h6 tag. Also you have linked (href="") all your projects to ID's where are the id's at? because as of now the links do not go anywhere. If you wrote those programs in trinket you can add the links that you can share from the trinket program.  -->

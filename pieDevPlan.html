<td>GOALS: What are your goals? (make sure your goals are specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and timely)</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> </td>

<!--specific/relevant-->
<td>What are your coding goals? Why are these your goals?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid"> We want people to learn to code by doing. If people learn by figuring it out and practicing in a safe space, it will better equip them to learn in a more robust environment. A co-working coding-type environment.</td>


<!--measurable-->
<td>What small pieces make up your goals?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">  Helping members figure out a starting point, and then with the club's support, we will "figuring it out" together along the way. So giving enough prompts to promote exploration but not "teaching a class." So the info goes into one ear out of the other while doing assignments that don't relate to how individuals want to code in real life. </td>

<!--relevant-->
<td>How does the completion of your goals look?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> A complete goal looks like a thriving coding community at the Northeast Branch of Richland Library. That means people who come with the sole intent to code around other people, like a coding cafe. That "cafe" will be a place where people love to share ideas and feedback with other like-minded individuals about their various coding pursuits. All while also being a safe space to screw up and be wrong, and even just be new and clueless.</td>

<!--timely/attainable-->
<td>What can you create that would express the completion of some of your coding goals? (choose one thing to start off with as your first Dream Project you can have as many as you like but we need to start somewhere)</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We would like to provide some sort of "start-up" instructions that will get members into the mindset of exploration of coding by doing. The instructions must progress them along far enough until they complete a project of their own creation. After which they will hopefully start over with something new or improve whatever they made. The point being they would have made something on their own. So in the future, they can make more things and will feel empowered to make more things with confidence.  </td>

<td>PROJECTS: What message do you need to communicate? Why?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> </td>

<td>What does your Dream Project look like fully completed?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">It looks like if someone new to the club as well as coding walks in one day, they will have a series of checks and balances that make sense that will direct them thru creating something (even if it is not all they hoped and dreamed) that works and does something close to the idea that they came up with.</td>

<td>What does your Dream Project look like broken down into smaller parts?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">
<ul>
<li>pt1: Hello, this is who we are; look at what we have done.</li>
<li>pt2: What would you like to try and do? Think about it. We'll wait.</li>
<li>pt3: Couldn't think of anything? You can copy what x,y, or z did. Check out their page and ask them questions. If you did think of something, what did you come up with? Time to do some research, we'll help, so you can figure out where you should start?</li>
<li>pt4:  How's it going? {5 seconds later} so how's it going now. By the way, we are the accountability police.</li>
<li>pt5: Stuck? We don't believe in stuck. Let's all stop what we are doing and try and help. Yay Success!</li>
<li>pt6: Wow! Your first draft is awesome! What's next for you?!</li>
<li>pt7: Live happily ever after creating new projects and improving old ones, and helping fellow coders along the way.</li>
<li>pt8: We wish there was a part 8 because 8 is a right-side-up infinity, but sadly there is not a part 8.</li></td>

<td>What do you need to know to create the smallest part of your Dream Project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Feedback on what we have developed so far.</td>

<td>What message are you trying to communicate with this project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Anyone can code, but it takes effort and perseverance. Especially perseverance. A support system can make it easier, and we want to be your support system. </td>

<td>FEED-BACK: What actions/attitudes do you hope others will adopt</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> </td>

<td>Who do you most want to see your finished project? Why?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We want potential club members to see our future product. They will (hopefully) give us feedback so we can improve our product. The fact that they see our product (hopefully) means that they will join our club. We also would like library staff to see our product to see a wonderful thing that will brighten their day.</td>

<td>What reaction do you want your audience to have when they experience your completed project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We want them to become interested and engaged in learning more code and coding and creating unique coding projects relevant to what they want out of coding. We also want them to come and co-code with us sometimes. </td>

<td>How can you try and ensure that your audience has the reaction that you want?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">. . . . . Not sure. </td>

<td>How will you be able to tell what reactions your audience is having to your project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">If we see increases participation during club times and increases in progress on people's web pages and personal projects. </td>

<td>MEDIUM: which communication channels do you intend to use? (in person online marketing materials etc)/ What communication mediums do you intend to utilize? (email if you chose online)</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> </td>

<td>How does your Dream Project look? What makes it look that way?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> We want it to look like a series of web pages with instructions, but we want it to feel like a mystery challenge. The following "challenge page" only opens up after proof of completing the last challenge, like a spy who picks up the envelope with the next mission from a random location each time. Regarding the pages' look, we will use HTML, CSS, and maybe Javascript to make the pages look the way they do. We don't see ourselves getting too artsy or graphic-ie. </td>

<td>How will you make the different aspects of your project look the way they do? Digital manipulation, Physical creation,  Both, Neither, Something else?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> We will control the look of our websites with digital manipulation 100%. </td>

<td>Are you using multiple vehicles to reach your audience? For example, do you have a blog, a newsletter, and a website, or do you just have a website? Why or why not?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> We are using multiple web pages, as well as personal feedback. With us updating the club members webpage with every change they make that is also providing a form of interaction as well.  </td>

<td> Could you change how your viewer engages with your project? What difference would that make?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> . . . . . Maybe...we dont know. </td>

<tr id="blk">
<td>MILESTONES: what are the milestones of your message and when should you reach them?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> . . . . . </td>

<td>What tasks do you need to complete? Which ones are more important? Why?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">As far as tasks that need to completion, we need to create the prompt pages. Then we need to get some feedback from the design and readjust. </td>

<td>What accomplishments would you consider most important in your project timeline?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We would say feedback because that is going to be the most challenging task to do. </td>

<td>Do you have a specific timeline in which you need (or want) to be done with certain aspects of your project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We want to be done with this task before we open back up to in-person programming. </td>

<td>Could setting up a reward system for reaching certain points in your project be benaficial? What would that look like?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">We don't think so. The greatest reward is finishing. </td>

<tr id="gry">
<td>ENGAGEMENT: how frequently do you expect to be in contact with your audience?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Ideally, we expect our audience to contact us at the min once/month at the max at least once per week. </td>


<td>How often does your audience interact with your project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> Ideally, our audience will interact with our project at least once per month. </td>

<td>Is your audience's interaction dependent on you putting out some sort of content?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Yes, after the initial interaction. Then we will need to review the code as well as update website files. </td>

<td>Is audience interaction dependent only on some sort of advertisement plan? Why or why not? What encourages people to interact with your project?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Yes. The club meets at the Northeast branch of Richland Library, so we are dependent on an advertisement at that branch to let people know that we are a thing. We would love to find a way to advertise otherwise, though. </td>

<td>Do you have a call to action for your users? Why or why not?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Once the audience decides to interact initially, we have a call to action for every prompt after. We have a call to action for every prompt because the club's entire point is to call people to code actively. </td>

<td>EVALUATION: how will you evaluate your efforts?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;"> </td>

<td>What does the success of this project look like to you? Why?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Success looks like a thriving, vibrant coding community. That is what we are striving to create. </td>

<td>How can you express the success of your project with measurements? </td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">To track our success, we can measure the following. How many members will consistently attend meetings and the number of updates made to member pages. We can also track the number of projects that will be completed. </td>

<td>How will you know that this project is complete, or does this project have an endpoint?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">This project does have a type of endpoint. Once the coding community has developed, we will have to evolve to fulfill the community's needs to keep it thriving. At this point, we cannot imagine what that will be, but we do know that it will be. </td>

<td>What does the failure of this project look like to you? Why?</td>
<!-- ANSWER-->
<td style="background-color:darkorchid;">Failure of this project would look like a lack of interest and participation. You cannot create a community where the current community does not want one. </td>

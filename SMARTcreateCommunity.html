<ul style="font-size:30px;"><li>To create a community: most people that say they are not good at tech stuff also have no desire to try and be good at tec stuff. so why would they even show up? Also how do you even create a community from scratch?</li>
<h3> CREATE A COMMUNITY: how does one create a community?</h3>

	1.1) <a href="https://cmxhub.com/build-a-thriving-community-from-scratch/" target="_blank">(article link)</a> A person only becomes a member of a community when four things happen <ol> <li>The community aligns with their identity</li><li>They know how and are encouraged to participate</li><li>There is a reward (intrinsic or extrinsic) for their participation</li></ol> Now if your community is brand new and has no members yet, why would people do any of those things? There’s no social identity to align with, they have no idea how to participate, and there’s no guarantee of any reward. What you have to do is create those three elements manually.<br><br> YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM EXIST, ONE STEP AT A TIME.

<h2>The 10 Steps for Building a Thriving Community</h2>

<ol><h4>Phase 1: build the foundation of community</h4>

<li>FORM IDENTITY: find 10 potential members who fit the community identity you envision.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>"Before Product Hunt was a massive platform, it was just a group of people that met up for brunch." You probaly already have a good idea of who your ideal members are as you know what type of community would be a good idea for some. Identify 10 people who fit the type who could potentially be your first members. Thoughtfully curate these first members as they will set the tone for your entire community.</li>
	</ul>
<li>EARN TRUST: get buy in for a community from the members.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Since you have no community yet there is no way these first 10 members can trust the community. If the new members dont already know and trust you step one is building trust. At this stage they can't trust the community but they ca trust you and the idea of a community that you would help build. You want them to feel invested in the idea. (better yet you want them to feel like it's their idea, if they do they will care much more about making the community succeed.) So ask them for feedback. Ask:"would you be interested in coming to an event with other people interested in this topic?" </li>
	</ul>
<li>FUEL PARTICIPATION: bring them together, ideally in person.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>now that you have 10ppl who trust you and have expressed interest in participating in a community as well as given you ideas and feedback now you must start to build trust between members. Then their trust in you will translate to trust in each other and the group as a whole. (to help ppl build trust in a person do it in person or live online. The more intimate and interactive the better. Thin dinners and brunches where ppl can have deeper conversations vs. happy hours where convos are shorter and ppl stick to who they know)</li>
	</ul>
<li>REWARD: validate that members got value</li>
	<ul>
	<li>you want to ensure that the experience was valuable and that members felt rewarded for their participation. If they dont you can learn what didnt work and can try something else. Asking for member's feedback can also be a reward in itself. It lets ppl know that their opinion matters and that they are being listened to. This will increas the chances of them coming back again even if their first experience wasn't great. ((make them feel like their opinions matter not in the same way that ppl let you feel like their opinons matter because dont succeed))  </li>
	</ul>
<li>REPEAT STEPS 1-4: invite new members and give existing members the opportunity to invite someone new. </li>
	<ul>
	<li>Opportunity is not asking for a favor, but its giving them a chance to give someone else value by inviting them to this highly curated group. This also ensure they only bring really good ppl that will keep the quality high. You'll know that ppl are starting to feel as sense of belonging when they id as members of the group and are seeking out others on their own, and members are coming to multiple events.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Phase 2: move to scalable online platform</h4>
<ul><li>You now have a foundation of people who trust each other and feel as sense of community so you can start to provide a scalable platform for the community to interact (online: you are providing the tech to help your community members interact ore efficiently and discover one another on an ongoing basis.)</li></ul><br>

<li>IDENTIFY FOUNDING MEMBERS: Choose the right people to invite first.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>to get your online community started much like step 1 you need to curate the right ppl. this time you need to choose a core group that you think would be the most motivated to participate in a community like this.</li>
	</ul>
<li>EARN TRUST: get buy-in from the community for the new platform.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Like in step two you dont have a platform yet your memeber "cant" trust that you will bring them any value. Unlike step two you already have ppl that trust you and lots of ppl in a group so you can reach out to the ones you think would be interested and askf ro their feedback and options on the concept. That, like step two will help them feel invested in  the success of the commuinity and motivated to participate.</li>
	</ul>
<li>FUEL ONLINE PARTICIPATION: kick off the platform and facilitate interaction.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Now its time to invite all the ppl you got buy in from to be the first membes of the new platform. MAKE SURE TO ADD SOME CONTENT TO THE PLATFORM FIRST so that new members dont have to be the first to post and so you can set the example for how to use the platform porperly.(start to facilitate interaction) Post prompts and questions so members can respond. If you dont see interactions email your members (one) and ask them to post something to get things started if its a message board ask them to post a question. then email some other members and ask them to answer the question.  INTERACTIONS USUALLY DONT HAPPEN ORGANICALLY AT FIRST. YOU HAVE TO MAKE INTERACTIONS HAPPEN. (reddit made up fake users until interaction happen organically. ebay bought and sold its own products. do what you need to in order to set the example for your members as well as ensure they are getting value)</li>
	</ul>
<li>REWARD: collect feedback and validate reward.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Once ppl are using the platform you want to make sure they are getting value out of their participation, or they wont be motivated to come back and use the platform again. If members feel rewarded it will eventually start to form a habit loop that will keep them coming back (~Nir Eyal: hooked) Ask for feedback after enough time has passed for them to actually experience the value (two weeks). If they are not getting value you can try something else. Ask different questions, try different formats of interaction, keep experimenting.</li>
	</ul>
<li>GROW: invite more people and empower members to invite others.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>After the first 10 members have had time to interact and have an intimate experience AND there is a good amount of content on the platform start to grow the community SLOWLY. You dont want to start adding new members like crazy because that would undermin the safe, high quality environment you have created by curating the right ppl and building relationships between them. A good way to do this is to step 5. empower your members to invite new members. and keep hosting live events they will continue to drive energy and trust into your online community.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Overtime you will start to see layers of membership form. Members will continue to go through the community engagment cycle over and over again as they become more engaged members of your community. Some members will go on to become power users. Some will be active. Most will be passive.</h4>

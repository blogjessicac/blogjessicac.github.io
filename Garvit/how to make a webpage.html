<p> Hi, get your hands ready to make a webpage, as it takes a lot of typing. </p>
<p><i>Html is Hypertext Markup Language</i></p>
<p>With Html you can make webpages</p>
<p> It will be helpful to take <b>NOTES</b> on this thing and while learning Tags and stuff(coming on later) </p>
<p>The first thing you need to know are <b>TAGS</b>....They command the computer in html to do a certain job, an example of a tag is < >...and in the middle you write the command, like head, body, p(meaning Paragraph) etc.</p>
<p> To end a tag just put "/" before the command and after the Less than sign. </p>
<p>For the formatting, there is this part of html which is called <b>CSS.</b></p>
<p>I was just here to explain you about html and give its <i>basics</i></b></p>.
<p>You can learn all the tags online and how to format it.....but for now just learn these things.</p>
<p>Wait......are you ready for the most important part......................................<u><i><b>SAVE</b></i></u></p>

<p> 
Hello I am going to tell you how to make a website your website can be on any topic, I have made a website about myself and another about fancy rat care.

<!--Ms. J: if you want to make breaks inbetween your sentences without makeing new paragraphs you can use the <br> tag and it will put a space between things. you can use one or multiple i.e.

remember the three s's <br><br>
save <br>
save often <br>
save early <br>
 -->

Remember the three S's 
Save 
Save Often
Save Early

<!--Ms. J: you will need to use some sort of code editor to start writiing code. for html code you can use notepad or an editor. trinket is an online IDE (thats a integrated development environment) it lets you write and run code. something like code writer or notepad lets you write code but not run it. Since we are using html we can just save our code and see the results when we open it up in the web browser.   -->

<p>
Step 1:
First you will have to open somewere to make your website, some places I use are; Notepad, VNC*, or Trinket*.
* You have to make an acount for either of these programs.

Once you have opened a place to code your wesite you must type the folowing:


<!--Ms. J: you got this off my instruction :) so do you know what al these tags do? if not remind me to show you. I challenge you to write the instructions in your own words, you can use mine as a guide but I want to see how YOU teach someone to make a webpage. All you really need are the essential tags: html, head, title, body.  and some basic tags: h1-h6, p, ul, ol, img, and a to get started.

Also. none of the tags will show up on your site because the way they are written they will be coded you either have to leave out the <> or ask me how to make them show up as a printed thing instead of a coded thing. Yojit has the same question.

Step 2:
Next lets add some pictures

To do this first go to google, search the image you want to use, make sure the picture you use is "Labeled for noncommercial reuse with modification"
to find image in this catagory easily just go to tools at the top of the page then click usage rights and pick "Labeled for noncommercial reuse with modification"

Then save the image as what ever you would like. open your webpage code, type in;

____________________________________________________________________

<img src="put what you saved you image as here" alt= "put what you will call your image here"> 

_____________________________________________________________________

Example: <img src="ratpic.webp" alt= "rat">
